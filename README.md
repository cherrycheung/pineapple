 # Pineapple
 My personal home Raspberry Pi that shows me humidity and time on the Sense HAT LEDs using a ROS state machine.
 
 ## Future plans
 - State machine:
    - add more states and let joystick switch states
 - Show the following information:
    - weather forecast
    - temperature (but needs to be calibrated since the sensor is too close to the CPU of the pi)
 - Hardware:
    - use camera/sensor to detect people -> security cam features
