 My personal home Raspberry Pi that shows me relevant information on a 7 inch screen. Currently updating information in a ROS state machine:
 - humidity from a Sense HAT
 - DarkSky API to show today's weather summary, tomorrow's weather summary and current temperature
 
 ## Future plans
 - Use the touchscreen or Sense HAT button to control more stuff
 - Hardware:
    - use camera/sensor to detect people -> security cam features
